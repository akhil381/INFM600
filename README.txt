#INFM600
Dataset creation for INFM600 Information Organization assignment

Version
-------

Version 1.0 (October 2015)


Description
-----------

The combination of datasets on Public Presubmission Community Meetings, Bus Routes and Bus Stops in Howard County led to the creation of the new dataset "Bus Connectivity to Community meetings". This dataset can be useful in verifying the following hypothesis:

    - "Howard County has poor bus connectivity to places of community meetings leading to a low public attendance." 

The result would be best reported using a geographical map. Bus routes can be depicted by colored lines representing different bus routes. Places (points) of community meetings and bus stops can be represented by two different colored pins. A dotted straight line can be drawn from the place of meeting to nearest bus stop. As the map is drawn to scale, this dotted line can help in finding the distance between two points. The bus routes will show the connectivity of various locations to places of community meeting. This would help us identify whether public transport is a major cause leading to low public attendance at community meetings.

This dataset has been generated according to the requirements of the assignment for course INFM600, Fall 2015, at the University of Maryland, College Park.
